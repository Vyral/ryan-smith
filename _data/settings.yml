  about_markdown: |
    Always feeling a natural interest in real estate, pursuing a career as a Realtor has been an exciting and rewarding experience! It's always a wonderful thing when someone's personality and interests compliment such an enjoyable passion, and I can't even think of doing anything else! We pride ourselves in our service to our clients, and thoroughly enjoy helping people through their real estate transactions!

    Achieving our clients' goals is our first priority, and it's also the true measure of success for any real estate agent! As for the past couple years, business has been absolutely PHENOMENAL! We've been able to steadily increase our market share in the local real estate market and continue selling an incredible number of homes. Ultimately, excelling in real estate comes down to the outstanding service and value you provide to your market and we truly count it a blessing to help so many great folks. I can't even begin to tell you how much I appreciate the opportunities you have given us to serve.
