As we end spring and head into summer, do yourself a favor by tackling these five home maintenance tips:

**1. Inspect your brick, stone, or any concrete outside your home:** Anytime there are dramatic temperature or moisture changes, these materials can begin to crack. This can be a safety concern, not just a cosmetic issue.

 **2. Feed your lawn:** It's about to get really hot, so make sure your lawn has the water and nutrients it needs to stay lush and green. If you plan to sell your house, this is especially important.

**3. Check out wood fences:** Temperature and moisture changes can cause wood to warp and twist.

 **4. Put down fresh mulch:** Nothing makes your lawn and landscaping pop quite like this. Planting some fresh flowers along with fresh mulch will make it pop even more.

 **5. Get the grill ready:** Dust it off and clean it up so it's ready to cook some nice steaks. Dust and gunk tend to build up on grills over the winter, so make sure it's taken care of before you start to cook out.

Whether you plan to sell your house or not, these tips will all make your home stand out for the summer. If you have any questions for us or you're thinking of buying or selling real estate this year, give us a call or send us an email soon. We'd love to help you!
