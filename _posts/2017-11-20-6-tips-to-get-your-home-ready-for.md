If you plan on having friends and family stay at your house this holiday season, here are six tips that will get your house in top condition.

First, make over your guest room. You don’t have to spend a lot of money to do so. For most people, the guest room functions as a catch-all storage room, so clear out any unnecessary items from it. It also might be a good idea to buy a new set of sheets for the bed or repaint any dingy furniture.

Next, polish the silver. If you have silver kitchenware you plan on putting out, make sure it looks nice and clean instead of tarnished or drab-looking.

Third, make the house inviting. You can go to stores like TJ Maxx or Tuesday Morning and find nice items to set out or other things like guest soap, hand towels, and slippers that can really make people feel welcome when they stay at your place.

You should also think about the functionality of your home. If someone stays in your guest room, they’ll need room for their clothes and other items they’ll have to put away. This is why, again, it’s a good idea to empty out the closet and clear away your things so guests have room for their things. This is not only very easy to do, but it’s also very helpful.

It’s important to make sure that your home has good lighting. Just because you can walk around your house blindfolded at 2 a.m. doesn’t mean your guests will be able to do so, so be cognizant of having good lighting. The same rule applies to the outside of the home as well. Make sure your porch lights are working and there is a clearly lit path up to the house.

Lastly, make sure your home smells nice. Give your house a good cleaning and put out some air fresheners so everything smells clean and fresh.

If you have any more questions about how to spruce up your home for holiday company or are thinking of buying or selling a home in our area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
