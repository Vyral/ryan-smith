There are five signs that will tell you that you’re about to buy a house that you simply can’t afford.

Sometimes, when we’re working to help guide a buyer in their home purchase, they’ll ask us how they can know if they’re buying a house that is more than they can swing. Just because they were approved for a certain amount, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll have an easy time managing payments.

To gauge whether you’re stretching yourself too thin, keep an eye on the following five signs:

**1. Are your financing options unconventional or creative?** If you’re resorting to or being offered highly unconventional mortgage options to use in order to make your purchase work, it could be a sign that you’re swinging a little too high.

**2. Do you need down payment assistance programs to qualify for this house?** If the purchase or sale price of the home is so high that coming up with the down payment is a struggle, then it could be an indication that you’re trying to purchase outside your range.

**3. Do you have just enough money to cover your mortgage?** If you have enough money per month to cover your mortgage, but have little left over for the rest of your expenses, that’s a definite sign that you’re exceeding your limits. Don’t squeeze your budget too tightly.

**4. Are you considering taking money from your retirement funds?** If the only way to make your mortgage work is to take money from your hard-earned retirement funds, then that’s an issue.

**5. Do you have a bad feeling about the purchase?** If, during your purchase, you get an overwhelming sinking feeling that the whole thing is a bad idea, it’s a good idea to go with your gut. We do want to help you purchase a home, but you should also be happy with it. You’re the one who has to live in the house and manage your expenses, so your feelings are paramount.

If you’re a homebuyer who is experiencing one or more of these signs, or if you’re interested in purchasing a home, please feel free to reach out to me. We’re always here to help and provide excellent service to you.
