People tend to forget a lot of things when they’re moving. Here are five such items that you should be aware of.

When you’re moving into a new home, there’s a lot of stress involved. With that being the case, homeowners tend to forget about certain things during the process. Here is a list of the top five things you should remember when moving:

**1. Switch banks.** If you are at a regional bank and moving to a different region, you’ll need to switch banks.

**2. Take care of medical needs.** You might have to get a new doctor, too. This is another thing that can fall by the wayside during the moving process.

**3. Transfer your utilities.** This includes things like cable, utilities, and internet. Make sure your utilities are turned off at your old home and on at your new one.

**4. Prepare for transfer fees.** For example, if you have a home alarm contract, you might have to pay a fee or penalty for canceling your agreement early. Try to be aware of any expenses upfront and budget them into your moving costs.

**5. Raid the kitchen.** Don’t leave any food behind. The freezer is a common place where these items end up sitting for years until you move. One great idea is to take inventory of what’s in your freezer and start planning to cook it before the move happens.

These are five basic things that you should keep an eye on if you’re considering a move. If you have any questions in the meantime or if you are interested in buying or selling a home in the area anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
