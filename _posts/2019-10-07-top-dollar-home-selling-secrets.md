Here are the six secrets you need to know to sell your home for top dollar:

**1\. Make sure your curb appeal is spectacular.** Keep your mailbox upright and tidy, make sure there are no cracks in the driveway, and have your landscaping well-manicured. In fact, imagine there’s a laser beam running along the perimeter of your driveway and walkway leading to the front door—you don’t want any grass or plants hanging over the border.&nbsp;

**2\. Make good use of your rooms.** When marketing your home, each room needs to have a purpose. Sometimes people use dining rooms for their kids’ playroom, or they convert their sunroom into a storage room. That’s fine if you’re not selling your home, but once it’s on the market, each room needs to align with its purpose. If you have a dining room, make sure you stage it as a dining room.

**3\. List it slightly under market value.** Studies show that homes listed slightly under market value attract 75% of the buyer pool. If they’re overpriced, they only attract 35%. If you can attract a larger pool of buyers to your house who think they’re getting a good deal, you’re more likely to generate a multiple-offer situation. In these scenarios, homes often end up selling over their market value.&nbsp;

**4\. Describe your neighborhood’s culture.** Each neighborhood has unique traits and features, and sharing any features your neighborhood has that might not be readily apparent to buyers is a nice way to encourage them to make an offer.&nbsp;

**5\. Create a 3D tour of your house.** We do this for every home we list, and it gives buyers the opportunity to walk through your home without having to see it in person. These videos have accurate depth perception, so they make buyers feel like they’re inside your living room no matter where they are at. &nbsp;

**6\. Get a pre-inspection.** There’s a lot of value in handing a buyer a completed inspection report. This way, they know the home is in good standing and they’re more secure in their decision to purchase it. If they’re on the fence, this can oftentimes be the very thing that brings them off of it.&nbsp;
