Whether you’re thinking about selling your home or it’s currently on the market for sale, these three upgrades can help it sell for more money:

**1\. Upgrade to quartz countertops.** Quartz is the new, stylish thing for countertops. For a long time, the trend was granite, but experts say consumer trends have changed. If you have granite and it’s not very attractive or it’s dated, or if you have laminate countertops, quartz will attract many buyers. They may spend a bit more on your property or choose yours over another if it has quartz countertops.&nbsp;

**2\. Update the master shower.** It’s easier to touch up paint or get new fixtures, and typically, upgrading the shower will be more expensive. However, if the shower is in rough shape, buyers will shy away from your home. Statistically, it’s been proven that the master bathroom is a great place to spend money to attract buyers. Redoing the shower can potentially get your house sold for up to 3% more.&nbsp;

**3\. Apply a fresh coat of paint.** This is the No. 1 thing you should do to prepare your property for sale. It’s simple, but paint is almost always a 100% return on your investment. I say “almost” simply because paying others to paint your home can cost a bit more—but usually, those bids are reasonable. Painting is an excellent place to start your upgrades, it always makes a difference. Remember to use neutral colors so as not to alienate any buyers who may not like brighter or unusual hues.&nbsp;

Overall, these three renovations are likely to help your home sell more quickly and for more money.&nbsp;
