How do you sell your home amid the pandemic? As discussed [in a recent video](https://centraltexasrealestatejournal.com/straight-talk-about-our-new-normal.html){: target="_blank"}, it’s a remarkably great time to go ahead with a real estate transaction. If you’re selling, you can get an excellent price. If you’re buying, interest rates are fantastic.&nbsp;

However, a question we heard from many people pertained to how they would go about selling their house while the health crisis is still happening. You could still sell your property the way it’s always been done, but due to the coronavirus, there are a few extra measures that can be taken (if they’re not being taken already) to give you the best results. So, to sell your home amid COVID-19, here’s what you should do:

**1\. Focus on your virtual capabilities.** We need to be able to show your house virtually. We can make buyers feel as though they’re walking through your property, even when they’re not physically there. That is of great value to you. Nationwide there’s a huge push for this and we’re delivering.&nbsp;

However, we were doing this before the pandemic; we’ve been providing virtual options for a long time actually. We have all our own equipment to create this content, so we know how to do it well, as opposed to other real estate agents who are still trying to learn or outsourcing it to others.&nbsp;

**2\. Paint a picture of your house.** We’re selling the dream, so with photos, video, descriptions, and social media, we need to create an impression that allows buyers to envision themselves in your home.

**3\. Choose a great real estate agent.** Many of my previous points won’t work if you choose the wrong agent. Look for someone who has a track record of moving houses in your area. If you think a Realtor is too busy, that’s not a good reason not to call them.&nbsp;

The agents that do a ton of business are the ones doing what others aren’t, and that’s why they’re successful. Hire the person who is known for success. Our team is consistently in touch with a database of over 18,000 who are interested in buying or selling in central Texas. So during this health crisis, it’s particularly vital that we network with others and tell them about your property.&nbsp;

**4\. Listen to your Realtor’s advice.** Once you’ve chosen an exceptional real estate agent, do what they tell you because it’ll help speed up your sale and get you a better price. Help your home compete in today’s economy. You don’t want it to sit for a long time and have a band of people marching through your house. Ask your agent good questions. This is essential: If they’re great at what they do, they should not be scared to give you advice. They should have relevant answers and an explanation behind those responses.&nbsp;

**We’re always here to help** and provide superb service when you need us. If you have questions about selling or real estate in general, call or email us. We love and appreciate you, Central Texas\! We hope you’re doing great and staying healthy.
