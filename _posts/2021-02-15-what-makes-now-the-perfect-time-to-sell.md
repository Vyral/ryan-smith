Over the past 12 months, I’ve seen a higher rate of appreciation than I’ve ever witnessed, and many people are selling for top dollar. What makes now the best time to sell your house? There are three reasons:

**1\. Buyers are extremely motivated.** They’re having a hard time finding homes that check all the boxes. When they do, if the house is priced reasonably, it’s not uncommon for them to make an offer above the listing price and find themselves in a bidding war. I’ve seen offers as much as $20,000, $30,000, and even $40,000 over asking price. Making as much money as you can is never a bad thing when selling a home.&nbsp;

**2\. There’s less competition.** As I alluded to above, there aren’t many options for buyers to look at, which is pressuring them to make aggressive offers for homes. You’re competing against fewer sellers now, but that might not be the case in a few years. It wouldn’t be uncommon for a few market changes to cause inventory to increase. With inventory as low as it is now, you have a great opportunity to maximize your profits.&nbsp;

Usually, there’s a huge uptick in people wanting to list their homes after the first of the year, which means momentum is building for others to sell as we get further into 2021. Additionally, we saw more active buyers than usual in November and December, so we’re hitting a sweet spot in the market.&nbsp;

**3\. Inventory is low.** I keep saying this, but it’s worth repeating. We have barely a month’s worth of inventory available, so houses are flying off the market. If your home is one that appeals to people, I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it fetched multiple offers after being listed. You’ll be able to squeeze every penny out of your house that you possibly can.&nbsp;

If you’d like to take advantage of this market and sell for top dollar, call or email me today so we can hit the ground running. As always, if you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to hear from you.
