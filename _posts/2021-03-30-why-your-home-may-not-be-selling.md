Why isn’t your home selling? The real estate market is incredibly hot right now and houses are selling quickly, so why are some unable to sell? Here are the four main reasons why a property may just sit:&nbsp;

**1\. The house doesn’t look great.&nbsp;** If the home is cluttered, looks outdated, dirty, or messy, buyers won’t get a stellar feeling walking through it. These are the things that can make a house look “ugly.” Think about what you can do to help the property show better and appeal to buyers. They want to be wowed when walking through a home.

**2\. The price is too high.** Even in our current crazy market, you can still overprice your house. If your property seems overpriced, buyers will pass it by for one priced more reasonably. You and your real estate agent should consider this seriously if the home isn’t selling.

**3\. The house needs a lot of work.** Does your house come off as a project someone will have to undertake? If buyers feel it will take some time to fix up the property, that’s holding you back. If you feel your home has this issue, tackle some of those projects so buyers won’t feel like they’re buying a huge chore.&nbsp;

**4\. You’re not cooperating.** We’ve had experiences with sellers who only want to show the house in a narrow time slot, like a couple of hours per day. Whenever you restrict things very much, you’re shoving many buyers out of your buyer pool. Or, sometimes the problem is sellers not taking their agent’s advice about something that will help their property sell. If you’re choosing not to listen to a professional’s advice, that’s keeping your home from selling. One of the reasons you hire a Realtor is to give you advice about your sale, so why not listen to them?&nbsp;
