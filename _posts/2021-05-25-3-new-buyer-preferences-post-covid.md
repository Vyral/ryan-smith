The real estate market is crazy hot right now, and houses are flying off the shelves. People are making more money than ever on the sale of their homes but there's always the chance to make more. If you want to make the most on your sale, think about these three new buyer preferences that can really help get you top dollar.:

**1\. Storage space.** With people staying at home more due to COVID, we're seeing a trend that buyers want to see extra storage space for all their stuff inside their house.&nbsp;

**2\. Home office.** A lot of buyers are also looking for dedicated work-at-home space. That space could be a home office or simply a place for a computer.

**3\. Outdoor space.** Finally, people are looking for a larger yard or a patio where they can hang out outside with their family or friends. Having a fire pit and nice landscaping all goes into creating a great outdoor living space that buyers will pay a premium for.&nbsp;

I hope these three things have been helpful for you when you're thinking about how to maximize your future sale.
