As you can imagine, one of the biggest questions we’re hearing from everyone nonstop is, “Am I crazy not to sell my house in this hot market?” If you’re thinking about selling, is now the time to capitalize?

As you weigh this question, the answer should always come back to what’s personally best for you. The market will fluctuate, but that’s what matters most, and here are a few tips to remember while you examine your situation:

First, **ignore the media hype.** You’ll hear a lot of hype about how crazy the market is, and don’t get me wrong—it is crazy. But you need to focus on the facts of your neighborhood. Go on a fact-finding exploration of what’s going on in your neighborhood. What will affect you and what are the numbers looking like in your neighborhood? There’s hype everywhere, but that hype doesn’t necessarily apply to every single house in every single neighborhood.&nbsp;

After that, **consider what’s next.** If you need to sell now and move into another home, be cognizant of how that situation might look on the backside. What are you moving into? What are your options in light of what will eventually happen with your home sale?

Finally, **consider what will be easier to live with if you’re wrong.** Five years from now, you don’t want to be the person looking back and saying to yourself, “Oh my gosh, if only I had sold my house.” Nor do you want to be the person who knows they’d have been so much happier if they didn’t sell. Some people fall into indecision, and while you need to be aware of everything I’ve mentioned, remember that being hesitant to do anything due to fear isn’t healthy either.&nbsp;

After you follow these steps, make peace with whatever decision you make. If you’re looking to cash in and pull the equity out of your home, now’s a great time to do so. It’s always helpful to have a professional at your side when embarking on this process, so if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
