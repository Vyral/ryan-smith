I often get questions from sellers asking how they can sell their properties that need a lot of work. Sure, a house that needs a lot of work can be a little bit more challenging to sell, but it’s definitely possible. Here are some of the things that you can do to help sell a property that needs more work than a lot of other houses on the market.

**1\. Get a house inspection.** Have a reputable home inspector come over and give your property a rundown of everything that needs fixing. An inspector can give you more accurate information about the problems in your house, especially the ones that you want to strategically address first before putting it on the market. Knowing the issues with your house can also allow you to be more upfront with the buyer.

1. **Sell to an investor or bargain hunter.** You can find people who are looking for houses who are happy to do the work of fixing your house, so you don’t have to. Know that there’s a market for fixer-upper houses.

1. **Price realistically.** Give your buyer a little discount on the price to make it worth the price, money, and effort that they’ll put in to fix the house. Do not expect a full market value price for a house that needs $60,000 of work. At the same time, you most likely won’t be able to just deduct $60,000 from the market price and expect the buyer to invest the same amount to bring the property back to a competitive market price.

If you follow these tips, your house can still sell just fine. There’s always someone looking for a home exactly like yours.
