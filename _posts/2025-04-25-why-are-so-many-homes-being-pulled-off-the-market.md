Have you noticed more ‘For Sale’ signs disappearing without a ‘Sold’ sign replacing them? You’re not alone. In December alone, one in 10 listed homes was pulled off the market, a 64% increase from the same time last year. Typically, fewer homes sell in the winter, but this year’s spike is far beyond seasonal trends. With mortgage rates climbing back toward 7%, many buyers have decided to wait on the sidelines, leading to the lowest home sales in nearly 30 years. Meanwhile, many sellers aren’t willing to accept lower offers, opting to delist their properties instead of reducing prices. So, is this a sign of a weakening housing market?

As a professional real estate agent, I’ve helped countless homeowners navigate tough market conditions—whether they’re selling, buying, or just looking for the right strategy. Today, I’m going to help you understand what’s really happening in the market and how it affects your next move. Here’s what’s happening behind the scenes and what you need to know if you’re planning to buy or sell in 2025:

**1\. The ‘lock-in’ effect is slowly fading.** For years, homeowners with super-low mortgage rates have stayed put, unwilling to trade in their 3-4% mortgages for today’s higher rates. But that’s starting to change. Life events like new jobs, growing families, and financial shifts are pushing more sellers into the market—even if it means taking a small price cut. In fact, 78% of sellers recently surveyed by Zillow said life events, not market conditions, were their reason for moving. If you’re a seller, pricing your home correctly is more important than ever. If you’re a buyer, you may see more price reductions as motivated sellers adjust their expectations.

**2\. More inventory, but fewer buyers.** The number of homes for sale jumped 16% from last year, but buyers are still hesitant. Mortgage rates have increased to 7.04%, making homeownership less affordable for many first-time buyers. According to Zillow, 23% of listings saw a price cut in January—a record high for this time of year. If you’re selling, be prepared to price competitively or offer incentives. If you’re buying, you may have more negotiating power, especially on homes that have been sitting on the market.

**3\. A hidden wave of ‘shadow inventory.’** Many sellers who pulled their homes from the market plan to relist in spring when demand typically rises. That means we may see a flood of new listings all at once, increasing competition and possibly putting downward pressure on prices. If demand doesn’t pick up fast enough, sellers may have to adjust their prices to attract buyers. If you’re a seller, consider listing before the spring competition heats up. If you’re a buyer, patience could pay off—more listings mean more choices and possibly better deals.
